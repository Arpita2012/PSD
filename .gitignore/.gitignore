What is a PSD?
A .PSD file is a layered image file used in Adobe Photoshop. PSD, which stands for Photoshop Document, is the default format that Photoshop uses for saving data. 
PSD is a proprietary file that allows the user to work with the images' individual layers even after the file has been saved.
